## Keypoints
  - AWS Regions are seperate geographic areas that AWS uses to house infrastructure
  - An AWS availability Zone (AZ) is the logical building block that makes up an AWS Region
  - AWS Local Zones area a new type of AWS infrastructure deployment that places AWS compute, storage, database, and other selective services closer to large population, industry, and IT centers
  - # of edge locations > # of availability zones > # of regions
  - AWS foundational services consist of compute, storage, databases, and networking
  
  
## Quote 1:" Just to cite some of the most common use cases, if you distribute your instances across multiple Availability Zones and one instance fails, you can design your application so that an instance in another Availability Zone can handle requests.
  - This quote interests me because of the fact that utilizing multiple AZ's can ensure the success of applications created by orgaizations by having safety nets set up in case of instance failures
  
## Quote 2:"Each Country has its own Security & Compliance rules when the customer data is moving from one location to the other location.
  - I find the quote interesting because of the importance of your customer data meeting certain compliance certifications when being transported to different countries
  
  
New Facts:
  - Costs of AWS services can be different for each region because of cost, taxes, and manpower for the physsical infrastructure and data centers are different from region to region
  - Not all the AWS Services warrant the same SLAs, instead, each service abides by its own parameters about availability
  - Points of Presence locations consist of edge of locations and regional edge cache servers
  - A single data center can easily hold 10,000 racks each with 100 blades 
  
  
## Remaining Questions:
  - What are the downsides of having an endzone that is not close to an AZ?
  - I would like edge of locations used in a real world example
